**These are my configuration/dotfiles files.** 

There are bunch of things I need to check and fix/do:
- How to better manage the dotfiles ([Reference](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles))
- Use a configuration manager to make changes/ setup a new machine
- Make a list of other plugins/config I am using and check if/how I need to manage them : perl/bash script maybe !

*It is a work in progress !!*
